This is a simple local web application which allows to visualize countries
and places (cities, etc.) you have visited during travels.

There are gazillion of apps like that, here are the traits of this one:

 * Leaflet-based map with free-forever OpenStreetMap tiles
 * No server-side code, just static HTML+JS+CSS
 * No database, just a few JSON-in-JS files
